# Matrix-DoubleLinkedList

Implementation of basic functions of Sparse-Matrix Collection using Double Linked Lists

What I learnt from this project:
- Collections library
- how ADTs implemented using Linked Lists work
- when and why this type of ADT implementation should be used
- concepts of Single and Double Linked Lists
- pointers
